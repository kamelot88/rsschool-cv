## **Life goals**

I am determined to master the *web-developer* profession and strive to become a sought-after specialist in this field. I like to learn new things and solve complex and non-standard tasks. In the near future, my goal is to get knowledge and experience sufficient to get a job as a software engineer in the field of JavaScript / Front-end. My motto in life is: "He who seeks will always find!
> A noble person makes demands on himself, while an ignorant person only makes demands on others. Therefore, even in the company of two people, I will certainly find something to learn from them. I will try to emulate their virtues, and I will learn from their shortcomings myself. 
> 
> Confucius (Kun-tzu)
